This project was bootstrapped with [npx create-react-app].
The responsive layout is handled using bootstrap: [https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css]
To render the map in a modal, these external javascripts are included:
  "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.slim.min.js",
  "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/popper.js@1.16.0/dist/umd/popper.min.js",
  "https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"
